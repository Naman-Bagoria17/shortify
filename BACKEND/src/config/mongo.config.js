//it provides schema based solution for mongoDB
// mongoose is a library that:
// Helps define schemas for your MongoDB documents.
// Provides built -in validation and middleware.
// Makes working with MongoDB more structured and organized.

// The async keyword is used to define a function that returns a Promise and allows you to use the await keyword inside it.
// The await keyword is used to wait for a Promise to resolve before continuing execution.
// Connecting to a database takes time(a few milliseconds to a few seconds).
// It may involve:
// Resolving DNS of the MongoDB cluster.
// Opening a network socket.
// Authenticating credentials.So, mongoose.connect() returns a Promise â€” not an immediate value.
