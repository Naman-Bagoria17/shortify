import express from "express";//Express is the web framework youâ€™re using to handle HTTP requests and responses.Express gives you a clean way to define routes, middleware, and error handling instead of writing raw Node.js http servers.
import dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();//Loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env.
import connectDB from "./src/config/mongo.config.js";//connectDB initializes Mongoose and connects to your MongoDB cluster.
import shortUrl from "./src/routes/shortUrl.route.js";
import auth_routes from "./src/routes/auth.routes.js";
import user_routes from "./src/routes/user.routes.js";
import redirect_routes from "./src/routes/redirect.routes.js";
import { errorHandler } from "./src/utils/errorHandler.js";//A centralized error handler middleware.
import cors from "cors";//Enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing so your frontend (React, on a different domain/port) can make requests to your backend.
import { attachUser } from "./src/utils/attachUser.js";//a middleware that reads the JWT from cookies/headers and attaches the authenticated user object to req.user.
import cookieParser from "cookie-parser";//Middleware to parse cookies from incoming requests (e.g., JWT stored in req.cookies)

import path from "path";//this is Nodeâ€™s built-in path module. we use this To safely work with file and folder paths across operating systems (Windows uses \, Linux uses /).
//We use the Node.js path module to work with file and directory paths in a safe and cross-platform way. It helps us generate absolute paths instead of relying on relative paths, which can break depending on where the server is started. For example, when serving static frontend files with Express, I use path.join with __dirname to make sure the file path is always correct on any operating system

import { fileURLToPath } from "url";//fileURLToPath comes from Nodeâ€™s built-in url module. It converts a file URL(like file:///C:/project/app.js) into a normal file system path (C:\project\app.js).
//In CommonJS (require), you automatically had __filename and __dirname globals.
//In ES Modules, Node doesnâ€™t provide __filename and __dirname. To get them, we use fileURLToPath(import.meta.url) from the url module, which converts the current moduleâ€™s URL into a usable file system path. This is mainly needed when serving static files or working with absolute paths in an ES Module project.

import fs from "fs";//We import the Node.js fs module to work with the file system of OS. It allows us to read or write files from the backend, for example when serving static frontend files, handling file uploads, or writing logs. In our case, it ensures the backend can directly interact with the filesystem when needed.

//In ES, you donâ€™t have __dirname and __filename. These two lines recreate them so you can safely build absolute paths later (used for serving frontend files).
const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

const app = express();//creating the express application.

    ],
    //In a cross-origin request, browsers block cookies and authorization headers by default. By setting credentials: true in CORS, we allow the frontend to send cookies or other credentials along with requests, which is essential for maintaining authenticated sessions. On the client side, we also need withCredentials: true to actually include the cookies.
    credentials: true
